# News Scraper: In the News links

This project scrapes the _UCSC in the News_ page for data related to each link. Each HTML list item has class names and embedded `data-` attributes that this project parses and adds to a CSV file.

## Todos

- [x] Update the parser for the new format of the In the News page (it's now separated into year pages/formats).
- [ ] Add ability to select _Academic Year_ and view/download just that data.
